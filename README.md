All output files, input files, and the figure generated in the COANCESTRY analyses can be found in this repository.

Legend for COANCESTRY Figure: Box plots indicate the median (black line), 25% and 75% quartiles (box), range (whiskers), and outliers (black dots) of simulated values of different orders of relationships simulated on our dataset using two rxy estimators (LRM and QGM). There is substantial overlap and no significant differences between the means and confidence intervals generated from the two estimators.
